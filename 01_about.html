					<p>My name is <span class="bold">Andrea Jensen</span> and I am the artist behind the icing bag :)<p>
					
					<p>I was first introduced to cookie decorating when visiting my sister-in-law Amanda one Christmas and she taught me how to use royal icing. Fast forward a year when a friend was fundraising for Cystic Fibrosis (please read more about this horrible disease here) and I offered to make decorated cookies to help out.  We raised over $1000 through cookies alone, and I started getting inquiries for custom cookies for baby showers, birthday parties and more. From that humble beginning we are excited to see what the next year will bring!

					<h2>Why Cookies?</h2>

					<p>When you give a custom cookie, you give so much more than a delicious, fresh treat - you are telling the person that you thought of them specifically and what they would enjoy.  In a world where $5 coffees are commonplace, a custom cookie has a 'wow' factor that a gift card cant beat! </p>

					<p>Made with high quality ingredients (local when possible) it is the perfect gift for the person that has everything, a hostess gift, celebrating a new home, baby showers, weddings, birthday favours or party platters, the list can go on! </p>

					<p>As you are purchasing from a local Marketer, you can also feel good knowing that you are supporting people in your community too!
